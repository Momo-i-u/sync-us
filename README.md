Happy Valentine's Day! 🎁
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
So... it’s finally here!! Max, you really thought the gift was just a drawing for you hehe... if I look confident when I gift it to you, I might finally have beat my anxiety.

what is this?

It’s our own little space. All the functions and interaction design are considering OUR habits.

the functions!!

The Orbit Status: The Circle idea is from my Apple Watch hehe. This part was so difficult for me, I almost gave up honestly... but my AI helper guided me through it. It lets us show if we are Steady (normal), Alone (preference being alone), or Sync (preference being together/texting!!).

Protocols (The Dashboard): Here is where we track our shared projects. It has a progress bar we can manually move, a task list, and you can go to our Google Calendar just by clicking. I added a Finished list so projects move there when we are done, so that the main page stays clean and not messy.

Cinema Watchlist: Our movie night hub! We can search the movie, see the posters, and it links to IMDb. When we finish, we click "watched" and it moves to the bottom. You will only see a tiny red dot if I add a movie. If you add one yourself, no dot! Once you look at the Cinema page, it goes away.

The Stream & Vault: A simple place for us to drop links and quick notes. For the Vault, I linked it with our shared Google Cloud photos.

design & tech

The Logo: It’s an "S" (meaning sync) formed by two people's Google Calendar sidebars. The heartbeat is yellow because Max—-you label all our time together in yellow in your calendar!! And cute cats cuddling together... I made it gradient to make it look techy, but I actually hand-painted it on Procreate with an airbrush.

The Look: I wanted it to feel "Warm." No cold grays or sharp black boxes! I used creamy whites and soft mocha colors so it feels like a cozy home (Thanks teacher gemini for my color search).

The Tech stuff: I used React and Supabase. For the movies, I used the OMDB API and Linkpreview for the stream. Everything in the stream is end-to-end encrypted because I'm a bit anxious about privacy! I used GitHub to deploy and .env to protect the passwords so I don't have to pay for private hosting hehe. I'm trying my best to keep it 0 dollar.

I felt like such a beginner making this, but I'm so happy I finished all the functions I wanted. I hope it makes our life a bit more synchronized!
